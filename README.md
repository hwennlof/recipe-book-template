# CodeRefinery recipe book

We use this repository to teach Git and also to collect
some nice recipes.

This exercise is created from https://github.com/coderefinery/recipe-book-template.
If you wish to improve the exercise itself, please direct your pull requests
towards the template repository.

Let's see how pushing goes.

And now again, after updating rules. Have to go via a merge request now! Seems to work neatly.
